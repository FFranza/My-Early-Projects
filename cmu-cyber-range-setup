## Installing a Nested ESXi and Foundry Appliance OVA
### Install the Nested ESXi
The first step would be looking into installing a nested ESXi. Nested ESXis can be easily installed and deployed into ESXi. Use this link and install the latest nested ESXi: `https://williamlam.com/nested-virtualization/nested-esxi-virtual-appliance`

Set a chosen volume disk to at least 100 GBs as this VM server will be holding the devices

**DO  NOT SET THE SYSTEM TO BOOT AUTOMATICALLY**

Go into the ESXi shell by remoting in with the main ESXi's IP Address and login credentials. 

Go into `/vmfs/volumes/[Insert Datastore name here]/[Insert Virtual Machine Name] `:  

Run `vi [Insert Datastore Name].vmx` and insert these two lines at the end of the .vmx file


    guestinfo.ssh = "TRUE"
    guestinfo.createvmfs = "TRUE"`
This will enable the ESXi SSH daemon and create a new VMFS datastore from the largest disk in the appliance.

After inserting the two lines inside your .vmx file, boot up the nested ESXi.
### Deploy the Foundry OVA
The second step looking is installing your OVA from the foundry appliance repository. For a easy and quick install, go through the process
